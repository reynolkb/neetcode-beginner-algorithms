# Nth Factorial

## Description
Since the course has a repeat problem of Reverse Linked List, we are doing Nth Factorial which is a common problem and also in the notes. You have to use recursion to find the Nth Factorial of a number.

Example 1:\
Input:\
`3`\
Output:\
`6`\
Explanation:\
`1 * 2 * 3`

## Run Command
`poetry run python "3. Recursion/1. Factorial/1. Nth Factorial/nth_factorial.py"`
