# [Search in a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/)

## Description
You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer `val`.

Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals `val` and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return `null`.

Example 1:\
![Example 1](example_1.jpeg)\
Input: `root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2`\
Output: `[2,1,3]`

Example 2:\
![Example 2](example_2.jpeg)\
Input: `root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5`\
Output: `[]`
